cs50 not about programming
about modeling problems, data
input -> [    ] -> outputs; algorithms go in the box
algorithm - set of instructions to solve a problem, a recipe

computers operate on binary, code represents on/off
binary operates in 2^n instead of our typical 10^n
2^0 = 1 (1st place to the right)
2^1 = 2 (2nd place to the right)
2^2 = 4 (3rd place to the right)
2^3 = 8 (4th place to the right)
2^4 = 16 (5th place to the right)

ASCII - two digit codes for letters and punctuation

i for counting. He says it means "integer" I've heard "iterator" and "item". I've also heard that "i" was the first row on punch cards where numbers could be added.

This is an interactive art piece. Pressing space activates the googly eyes, which are coded independently (though they use the same counter variable). Clicking on the bow tie increments a separate iterator, causes Joe to laugh and plays the funky music all the way through the same number of times the bow tie is clicked. I wanted the music to not restart when the tie was clicked but couldn't figure that out. There is no way to stop the music until it has completed. You're welcome.
